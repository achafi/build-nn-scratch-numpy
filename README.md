Deep Learning - How to Build a Neural Network from Scratch with NumPy

We will build the model and we will feed it with inputs. What we expect from the algorithm is to learn the underlying relationship of
the data. Here's how we are going to approach the problem :

First we will import the relevant Python libraries for the problem at hand.

Second we will generate random data to train with.

Third we will create the targets.These are the correct values

Fourth we will plot the training data so you can visually see it.

We will define the variables we need.

We must create wait's biases and set a learning rate at the end.

We will conclude with an actual regression along the way each line of code will be explained to make sure everything is understood.
